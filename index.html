					<h2>Senior Software Engineer at Stanley Gibbons Group ltd., Morrisville, NC, USA</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">November 2013 - Present</p>
					<p>Stanley Gibbons is the market leader in the stamp collecting/philately market. Based in the UK and having opened an office in Morrisville, North Carolina, I was asked to relocate and join the growing engineering team there building a new multi-seller marketplace e-commerce website.</p>
					<p>Starting as a software developer, reporting to the VP of Engineering, I was working as part of an <strong>agile</strong> team building e-commerce features utilising object orientated <strong>PHP</strong> and the Symfony framework. This interfaced with our 10m records of product data held in <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> databases, accessed using Doctrine ORM/ODM and served to the frontend via <strong>ElasticSearch</strong>.</p>
					<p>After the initial version of the site went live, I progressed to Senior Software Engineer and became team lead of the Production Support team. This involves fixing any issues raised by users, staff or customers on any of our live websites (tracked through <strong>JIRA</strong>), be these routine site updates or out-of-band "hot-fixes". Alongside this I integrated our product data held in the <strong>NetSuite</strong> ERP/CRM over to our marketplace as well as work on general NetSuite development as requirements arise.</p>
